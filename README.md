<h2>No Human Being is Illegal on Stolen Land</h2> 
<p>A Chrome extension to replace anti-immigrant and xenophobic phrases and words such as "illegals", "illegal alien", "illegal immigrants", etc... to "undocumented immigrant" because no human being is illegal on stolen land.</p> 
<p>The extension keeps track of the number of times the anti-immigrant terms are used, highlights the areas where it makes the necessary changes, and provides a letter grading to the site ("A" - "F" scale).</p>
